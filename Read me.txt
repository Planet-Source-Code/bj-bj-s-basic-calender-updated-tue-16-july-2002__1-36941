BJ's Basic Calender:

NOTE: for newbies.

1: You must have msinet.ocx to start with.
1-1: msinet.ocx should be found in your Windows\System folder or your Windows\System32 folder. If you don't have it, can E-Mail it to you.

2: Open ShellLnk.vbp and change the properties for cShellLnk Instances to 5 and make ShellLnk.dll then save and Exit. If you don't have my altered version, go to unsupported on msdn CD 1. It should still work. I haven't tested it.

3: Open BJ's Basic Calender.vbp and make BJ's Basic Calender.exe and then save and Exit.

4: BJ's Basic Calender should now run.

Thanks BJ.
